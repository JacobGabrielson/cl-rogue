TODO:

* get save working
** cleanup after load from .sav file:
*** cur_armor
*** cur_weapon
*** oldrp?
*** !!! does this really matter?  depends on how cur_weapon and cur_armor used.  oldrp isn't...

* move "move" to cl-ncurses
* whoami in init.lisp busted
* XXX comment in monsters.lisp
* make sure GET_STR is used correctly everywhere (mvb)
* may be some places where incorrect trueness due to 0 not being "false" in Lisp
* skipped expansion of "~" -> "home" in parse_opts
* review use of "for" macro for off-by-one errors
* look for places that need (format nil ...)
* passwd() in wizard.c isn't ported, always returns t
* 2 func in rip.c not ported
* stuff like 'shell' in command.lisp not ported
